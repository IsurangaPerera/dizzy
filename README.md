# Dizzy

Dizzy is a search engine for the visible Dark Web. It supports the following:
- **Scalable web crawling over Tor:** Dizzy crawls all of the visible Dark Web in less than a day. This also allows Dizzy to check the health status of discovered domains, and whether they were updated, multiple times a day.
- **Automatic domain classification:** Dizzy automatically labels domains using various ML-based clasifiers. This includes the domain's category, safety, privacy, cryptocurrency usage, and visial-similarity to other domains.
- **Easy cloud deployment:** Dizzy is deployed with a couple of commands using K8s.
- **User-friendly frontend:** Dizzy exposes a Google-like interface to query the search engine.
